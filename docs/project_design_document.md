## Current Project Status

### âœ… COMPLETED MILESTONES

**Data Acquisition & Processing:**

- [x] Located HRDEM 2m DSM COG tiles (8_1, 8_2) for Hamilton area
- [x] Downloaded Niagara Escarpment Plan boundary shapefile
- [x] Downloaded Hamilton municipal boundary shapefile
- [x] **Successfully intersected boundaries to create precise study area**
- [x] Confirmed 2m DSM covers Hamilton escarpment completely
- [x] Set up conda environment with spatial libraries (gdal, rasterio, geopandas)

**Technical Decisions Made:**

- [x] **2m DSM selected** over 1m (balance of detail vs. processing efficiency)
- [x] **DSM chosen over DTM** (realistic visibility including buildings/trees)
- [x] **Cloud COG workflow** instead of local 77GB downloads
- [x] **Official boundary intersection** for scientifically-defined study area
- [x] **Recreation-focused use case** (finding chill spots with good views)

### ðŸ”„ CURRENT PHASE: Data Validation & Clipping

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. Validate COG access to HRDEM tiles
2. Clip DEM data using intersected boundary geometry
3. Prepare working dataset for viewshed algorithm development

## Key Technical Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Data Resolution: 2m DSM

**Decision:** Use 2m resolution Digital Surface Model
**Rationale:**

- **Sufficient Detail:** Captures buildings, forest canopy, terrain features adequately
- **Processing Efficiency:** 4x faster than 1m, manageable file sizes
- **Realistic Analysis:** DSM includes trees/buildings for authentic viewshed results
- **Scalability:** Can handle regional analysis without performance issues

### 2. Study Area Definition: Boundary Intersection

**Decision:** Intersect official Niagara Escarpment + Hamilton boundaries
**Rationale:**

- **Scientific Accuracy:** Uses authoritative, legally-defined boundaries
- **Precise Coverage:** Captures complete escarpment within Hamilton
- **Professional Methodology:** Demonstrates proper spatial analysis workflow
- **Defensible Results:** Based on official government data sources

### 3. Cloud-Native Processing: COG Workflow

**Decision:** Access HRDEM via Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs, clip remotely
**Rationale:**

- **Efficiency:** Download only needed area (MB vs. 77GB per tile)
- **Modern Approach:** Industry-standard cloud geospatial processing
- **Storage Savings:** Minimal local storage requirements
- **Always Current:** Access latest government data directly

### 4. Recreation-Focused Use Case

**Decision:** Optimize for finding "chill spots with good views"
**Rationale:**

- **Personal Motivation:** Genuine user need drives better development
- **Validation Advantage:** Can personally test all recommendations
- **Unique Positioning:** Different from typical GIS portfolio projects
- **Practical Value:** Creates actually useful recreational tool

## Enhanced Viewshed Algorithm Design

### Core Technical Components

**1. Basic Viewshed Calculation**

```python
# Line-of-sight algorithm accounting for:
- Observer height (1.7m standard person height)
- Earth curvature (for distant views >10km)
- Terrain occlusion (hills, valleys)
- Surface features (buildings, trees via DSM)
```

**2. Recreational Scoring System**

```python
recreational_score = weighted_average({
    'scenic_quality': 40%,      # Lake visibility, skyline views, natural areas
    'privacy_level': 30%,       # Seclusion, distance from crowds
    'accessibility': 20%,       # Walking distance, terrain difficulty
    'weather_protection': 10%   # Wind shelter, overhead cover
})
```

**3. Advanced Features**

- **Reverse Viewshed:** Who can see you? (Privacy analysis)
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Winter vs. summer visibility through vegetation
- **Time-of-Day Optimization:** Best lighting conditions
- **Multi-criteria Analysis:** Combine visibility with practical factors

---

## Validation Strategy

### Ground Truth Photography Plan

**Systematic Field Validation:**

- **Phase 1:** Test 5 known viewpoints (Dundurn Castle, Devil's Punchbowl, etc.)
- **Phase 2:** Validate 10-15 algorithm-predicted spots
- **Phase 3:** User testing with local hikers/photographers

**Documentation Protocol:**

- Panoramic photos from each viewpoint
- GPS coordinates and elevation readings
- Access route documentation
- Privacy/crowding assessment
- Weather/visibility conditions

**Success Metrics:**

- 85%+ accuracy in landmark visibility prediction
- Strong correlation (r>0.7) between predicted and actual scenic scores
- User satisfaction >75% for algorithm recommendations

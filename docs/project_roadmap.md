## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:

- **Performance Issues:** Start with smaller study area, optimize incrementally
- **Data Quality Problems:** Have backup data sources identified
- **Algorithm Complexity:** Implement basic version first, enhance iteratively

### Timeline Risks:

- **Scope Creep:** Stick to core features, defer nice-to-haves
- **Learning Curve:** Allocate buffer time for new technologies
- **Validation Delays:** Weather-dependent field work has backup plans

### Success Criteria:

- **Technical:** Interactive viewshed analysis with <10 second response
- **Practical:** Accurately identifies 8/10 high-quality viewpoints
- **Portfolio:** Professional application suitable for employer demonstration

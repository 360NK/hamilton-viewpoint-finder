## Updated Risk Assessment

### Current Blockers:

- **COG Performance:** 250 sample points too slow for interactive use
  - **Mitigation:** Reduce to 10-20 points, optimize reading strategy
- **Internet Dependency:** COG access requires stable connection
  - **Mitigation:** Implement caching, graceful fallbacks

### Technical Risks:

- **Real-time Requirements:** <10 second response target challenging
- **Scope Expansion:** Niagara Escarpment broader than original Hamilton focus
- **Field Validation:** Weather-dependent validation schedule

### Success Criteria (Updated):

- **Technical:** Functional viewshed analysis with reasonable performance
